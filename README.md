## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- TuShare 0.7.4
- Pandas 0.19.2
- Keras 1.2.2
- Numpy 1.12.0
- scikit-learn 0.18.1
- TensorFlow 1.0 (GPU version recommended)

I personally recommend you to use Anaconda to build your virtual environment. And the program probably cost a significant time if you are not using the GPU version Tensorflow.
